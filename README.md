# Remover-PRO
Remover-PRO is a custom-developed software tool designed to unlock and manage stubborn system files on Windows 11. It enables users to delete, rename, or unlock any file or folder—even the most protected and secured ones—that are locked by the system or other processes, which often prevent standard file operations.
